## Who I Am

I am focused on **building production-style DevOps systems**.

My work centres on:
- Automating software delivery with CI/CD
- Designing and provisioning cloud infrastructure as code
- Embedding security into pipelines and platforms from the start

This GitHub documents a **deliberate progression into DevSecOps**, with long-term intent to operate in **security-critical domains such as health technology and high-impact platforms**.

I optimise for correctness, clarity, and real-world relevance.

## What I’m Working On Now

- Linux fundamentals and system operations  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation  
- Docker and container-based workflows  
- AWS cloud foundations  
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform  
- Core security principles applied across DevOps systems  

Everything here is designed to map directly to **junior DevOps and platform engineering roles**.
